Here’s a plain‐English breakdown of what each gate does and how you’d typically use it, **without** worrying about Minecraft specifics. You can imagine each gate has one or two “input” signals (ON or OFF) and one “output” signal (ON or OFF). In programming terms (like in Roblox Lua), ON is often treated as `true` and OFF as `false`.

---

## 1. NOT Gate
- **What it does:** Flips the signal.  
  - If the input is ON (`true`), the output is OFF (`false`).
  - If the input is OFF (`false`), the output is ON (`true`).
- **In Lua code:** 
  ```lua
  output = not input
  ```
- **Plain example:** A NOT gate is like a light switch that *inverts* the state. If the light was on, flipping the switch turns it off, and vice versa.

---

## 2. AND Gate
- **What it does:** Outputs ON only if *all* inputs are ON.  
  - If both inputs are ON (`true`), the output is ON (`true`).
  - Otherwise, the output is OFF (`false`).
- **In Lua code:**
  ```lua
  output = inputA and inputB
  ```
- **Plain example:** Two people must each press a button to open a door. If either person *isn’t* pressing their button, the door stays closed.

---

## 3. OR Gate
- **What it does:** Outputs ON if *at least one* input is ON.  
  - If both inputs are OFF (`false`), output is OFF (`false`).
  - Otherwise, output is ON (`true`).
- **In Lua code:**
  ```lua
  output = inputA or inputB
  ```
- **Plain example:** If *either* of two players flips a lever, the light turns on.

---

## 4. XOR (Exclusive OR) Gate
- **What it does:** Outputs ON if the inputs are *different*.  
  - If inputA ≠ inputB, output is ON (`true`).
  - If inputA = inputB, output is OFF (`false`).
- **In Lua code (one way):**
  ```lua
  output = (inputA and not inputB) or (not inputA and inputB)
  ```
- **Plain example:** Imagine two switches that control a single lamp in a hallway. If you flip one switch (while the other stays put), the lamp toggles. If both switches are the same (both up or both down), the lamp is off.

---

## 5. XNOR (Exclusive NOR) Gate
- **What it does:** Outputs ON if the inputs are *the same*.  
  - If both are ON or both are OFF, output is ON.
  - Otherwise, output is OFF.
- **In Lua code (one way):**
  ```lua
  -- XNOR is basically the opposite of XOR
  output = not ((inputA and not inputB) or (not inputA and inputB))
  ```
- **Plain example:** Two switches control a lamp, but the lamp only turns on if both switches are in the same position (both ON or both OFF).

---

## 6. NAND Gate
- **What it does:** Outputs ON unless *all* inputs are ON.  
  - If both inputs are ON, output is OFF.
  - Otherwise, output is ON.
- **In Lua code:**
  ```lua
  output = not (inputA and inputB)
  ```
- **Plain example:** Think of an AND gate, but reversed. It’s ON in every case *except* when both inputs are ON.

---

## 7. NOR Gate
- **What it does:** Outputs ON only if *all* inputs are OFF.  
  - If both inputs are OFF, output is ON.
  - Otherwise, output is OFF.
- **In Lua code:**
  ```lua
  output = not (inputA or inputB)
  ```
- **Plain example:** Think of an OR gate, but reversed. It’s OFF in every case *except* when both inputs are OFF.

# How you might use these in Roblox

Let’s say you want players to connect objects in your game (like wires or signals) to create logical behaviors:

1. **Represent signals as booleans**:  
   - A lever’s state can be `true` (ON) or `false` (OFF).  
   - A button press can be `true` while it’s pressed, and `false` otherwise.

2. **Create “Logic Gate” parts**:  
   - Each gate part has script code that reads its inputs (two booleans) and calculates the output using the logic above.

3. **Hook up inputs and outputs**:  
   - If a player connects a lever to the input of an AND gate, the gate script checks that lever’s state.  
   - If the gate has two inputs (say, two levers), it calculates `output = leverA and leverB`.  
   - The gate’s output might then control a door, a light, or feed into another gate.

4. **Visual feedback**:  
   - You can show the output by lighting up a small indicator (like a neon part) when the gate’s output is `true`.  
   - This helps players see the effect of wiring the gates differently.

By chaining gates, players can build complex logic systems—just like building circuits in real life or in Minecraft redstone, but now in Roblox.

---

**Key idea:** Each gate is just a small “if/then” rule about how inputs become outputs. You can combine these gates to create any logical setup you want—whether that’s locking doors unless two players press two buttons at once (AND), toggling lights with multiple switches (XOR), etc.
